<p>Kristen is a full-stack web developer who loves nature, puppers and doggos, reading, and so much more.</p>
<p>When not trying hard to get React components to work, she is trying hard to get students in the k-12 public education system to work.</p>
<p>Like most people, one of Kristen's "likes" is music; here you can hear a couple examples of beloved songs.</p></div>
