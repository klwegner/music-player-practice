        <p>This was made for fun with React. I wanted to practice with React's useState and useEffect hooks.</p>
        <p>Many tutorials were tried, but in the end Mathieu Media's video <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH2FmLzWKr4'>'Build Custom Audio Controls in React'</a> got me where I wanted to be--with a functioning music player with audio controls. One hundred thanks!
        <p>Audio control icons were all sources from <a href='https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/'>MUI</a>. Thanks, MUI!</p>
        <p>I also decided I would finally mess around with <a href='https://getbootstrap.com/'>Bootstrap</a> and <a href='https://animate.style/'>the Animate.css library... The results of which you have hopefully noticed!</a></p>
